## 🌌what is this place??
```
$ ls -F projects/
```
🪴 just a lil garden of personal experiments    
🛠️ tiny tools, half-broken ideas
🪄... maybe some magic  
✨ some broken code, some working spells  
🔥 forged in 42 fire (*ﾉ▽ﾉ)

## 🧩 42: My Arcane Library 📚🔮 (๑>ᴗ<๑)
```
$ read --tome "ancient_algorithms.grimoire" 
```

it's less a school and more a boundless arcane library,
brimming with forgotten lore and shimmering scrolls of code! 📜✨🌌
And I'm just here, deciphering the secrets of the code! (´｡• ᵕ •｡`)

✨ no lectures, just endless quests for knowledge forged together with fellow spellweavers! 🔮 we learn from each other's spells, and the thrilling discovery of a perfectly cast function! 🪄 (ﾉ´ヮ´)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
